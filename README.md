# Scout Recruiter

A dynamic recruiting outreach assistant built with React, Flask, and OpenAI Assistants. It combines an AI-driven chat interface to gather the user's recruiting goals and preferences, with a collaborative workspace where generated outreach sequences are displayed and can be refined by the user directly in the workspace or via the chat interface.
